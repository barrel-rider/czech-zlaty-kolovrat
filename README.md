# czech-zlaty-kolovrat
This is a copy of Erben's Czech poem Zlat√Ω kolovrat (The Golden Spinning Wheel) with glosses of difficult or rare words appearing in tooltip form.
Text in yellow highlight show translations that need to be verified.

To get proper line indents, I use the <pre> tags. What is not immediately evident is that the lines have a combination of spaces and tabs to get the right format. In Notepad, the lines of each stanza are all left-aligned when they appear in a browser properly staggered.
